# Geometric Classes

For this assignment, you will create a Circle class and a Square class in Ruby. Let the tests drive your development.


## Instructions

Install the requirements:

```
bundle
```

Run the test suite:

```
rspec spec
```

Or, let `rake` run the test suite for you:

```
rake
```


## Circle class

The Circle initialize method should take the radius as a required argument, and optional x and y coordinates, which represent the center of the circle. The x and y coordinates should default to the origin point (0, 0) if not provided.


### Methods

* radius - Returns the radius of the circle
* x - Returns the x coordinate of the circle
* y - Returns the y coordinate of the circle
* diameter - Returns the calculated diameter of the circle
* area - Returns the calculated area of the circle
* perimeter - Returns the calculated perimeter, or circumference of the circle

Use the formulas provided at [WolframAlpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=circle) as a guide.

You may use the Ruby constant `Math::PI` instead of defining it yourself.


## Square class

The Square class has many of the same methods as the Circle class. The Square initialize method should take the length of one side as a required argument, and optional x and y coordinates, which represent the center point of the square. The x and y coordinates should default to the origin point (0, 0) if not provided.


### Methods

* radius - Returns the radius of the square
* x - Returns the x coordinate of the square
* y - Returns the y coordinate of the square
* length - Returns the length of the square
* width - Returns the width of the square
* diameter - Returns the calculated diameter, or diagonal of the square
* area - Returns the calculated area of the square
* perimeter - Returns the calculated perimeter of the square
* contains_point?(x, y) - Returns true if the provided coordinates fall within or on the boundaries of the square. Returns false, otherwise.
